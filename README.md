# Music_Genre_Classification

Music genre classification forms a basic step for building a strong recommendation system.

The idea behind this project is to see how to handle sound files in python, compute sound and audio features from them, run Machine Learning Algorithms on them, and see the results.

In a more systematic way, the main aim is to create a machine learning model, which classifies music samples into different genres. It aims to predict the genre using an audio signal as its input.

The objective of automating the music classification is to make the selection of songs quick and less cumbersome. If one has to manually classify the songs or music, one has to listen to a whole lot of songs and then select the genre. This is not only time-consuming but also difficult. Automating music classification can help to find valuable data such as trends, popular genres, and artists easily. Determining music genres is the very first step towards this direction.

Dataset:
  For this project, the dataset that we will be working with is GTZAN Genre Classification dataset which consists of 1,000 audio tracks, each 30 seconds long. It contains 10 genres, each represented by 100 tracks.

        The 10 genres are as follows:

            1)Blues
            2)Classical
            3)Country
            4)Disco
            5)Hip-hop
            6)Jazz
            7)Metal
            8)Pop
            9)Reggae
            10)Rock
